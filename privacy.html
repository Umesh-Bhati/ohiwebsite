 <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
 
 <p>It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</p>
 
 <p>There are three basic categories of information we collect:</p>
 
 <p>·       <strong>Information you provide.</strong></p>
 
 <p>·       <strong>Information we get when you use our services.</strong></p>

 <p>Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p>
 
 <p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>
 
 <p>When you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us. For example, most of our services require you to set up an account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, email address, phone number.</p>
 
 <p>When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.</p>

 <p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>

To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.
